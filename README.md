# Japanese-stemmer
Here a Japanese stemming algorithm I made for a school project, which is based on Martin Porter's Porter Stemming Algorithm. Unlike Porter's algorithm, which mainly removes a word's ending, this stemming algorithm conjugates a word into plain form. Although the code works there is still room for improvemnt, and feedback is appreciated.
